\title{(Internal) Piece-wise generation of Bread and Meat matrices.}
\usage{
bread11(model)

bread22(model)

meat11(model, cluster = NULL)

meat22(model, cluster = NULL)

bread21(model, eta)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{For Bread & Meat that can be calculated using sandwich package,
we only need the model, either first or second stage, depending.}

\item{cluster}{For Meat only; A vector defining clusters.}

\item{eta}{Estimated version of the coefficient on the interaction between
predicted and treatment. This could be from a model or a hypothesis.}
}
\description{
Computes the Bread and Meat matrices. The diagonal elements are typical
sandwich estimators, with scaling, and thus only use the \code{model}
argument. The off-diagonal Bread element requires further specification.
